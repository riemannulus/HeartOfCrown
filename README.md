Heart of Crown is a deck-building card game.
Each player starts with the same deck, strengthens that deck with strategic cards,
and finally one player will declare victory by throning the princess he controls.
Each player's deck starts with seven "Rural" territory cards and three "Apprentice Handmaid" succession cards
(an unreliable subject). Using the currency (coins) generated by your "Rural" territory cards,
you incorporate cards from the market into your deck according to your own strategy.
